    This repo features works produced during a Year 3 module focusing on how data is stored on the web. The module primarily focuses on XML, JSON and AJAX requests, exploring their individual strengths in application. The module consisted of 2 assignments, namely the TMA (25%) focusing on XML technologies and the FMA (75%) focusing on JSON, AJAX and API interactions with JS technologies.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The module followed two tasks namely the TMA (25% weighting) and FMA (75% weighting).

**TMA**

The TMA focused on the production of an XML document with a structure capable of holding the data for BBC recipes. In addition to the XML document, an XSD (XML Schema) file was produced which was capable of validating XML documents to comply with the established schema. The final section of the TMA followed the creation of an XSL (XML stylesheet) capable of producing HTML5 markup of the web data contained within the XML file. The XSL file was required to also utalise a CSS stylesheet to produce a refined end result. *My final submission attained a mark of 88/100 - feedback included in TMA folder.*

**FMA**

The FMA focused on the production of two applications. 

The first application followed the deployment of a JSON document responsible for storing UK weather summary data. The JSON document was accessed through AJAX asynchronous requests and would refresh at a pre-set interval through the use of setTimeout()

The second application followed the deployment of a live UK City weather data applet which utalised API calls to OpenWeather API to present weather conditions for a user-specified country + city in the UK.

*My final submission is currently awaiting marking*
